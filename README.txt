evoMPS
-------

evoMPS simulates dynamics (real or imaginary time) for matrix product states 
(MPS) using the time dependent variational principle (TDVP).

It is based on an algorithm published by: 

* Jutho Haegeman
* J. Ignacio Cirac
* Tobias J. Osborne
* Iztok Pizorn
* Henri Verschelde
* Frank Verstraete

which is available on arxiv.org under arXiv:1103.0936v2 [cond-mat.str-el]
<http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0936v2>.

For details, see doc/implementation_details.pdf and the source code itself,
which I endeavour to annotate thoroughly.

evoMPS is being developed as part of an MSc project by Ashley Milsted,
supervised by Tobias Osborne at the Institute for Theoretical Physics of
Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover <http://www.itp.uni-hannover.de/>.
