evoMPS
-------

evoMPS simulates dynamics (real or imaginary time) for matrix product states 
(MPS) using the time dependent variational principle (TDVP).

It is based on the algorithm published by Haegeman et al.
available on arxiv.org under arXiv:1103.0936v2 [cond-mat.str-el].

For details, see doc/implementation_details.pdf and the source code itself,
which I endeavour to annotate thoroughly.
